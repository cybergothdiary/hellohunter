                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    A professional assassin and an extremely skilled Nen practitioner. He is the father of Silva Zoldyck and grandfather of Killua Zoldyck.

                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>
                    While Zeno is a witty old man, his advancing age has not dampened his quick thinking and speed in battle. Despite his senior citizen status, he is a very formidable tactician and a skilled user of Nen. He remains calm and collected at all times and displays a unique sense of pragmatism. He takes satisfaction in being an efficient assassin and that seems to be his only conceit. Killing is just a job to him and emotion doesn't enter into it. He only risks his life if there is a reward to be gained. Zeno has high hopes for Killua, that is why he trusts the boy's ability. He also possesses great respect for Isaac Netero: when others claim that they are two equals, he immediately dismisses this claim, stating Netero to be much more powerful and experienced than him.

                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    Zeno is the previous patriarch of the Zoldyck Family. He only had one son Silva, who was born from an unnamed mother. He is the grandson of Maha Zoldyck. Being a member of the Zoldycks, Zeno was trained at a tender age in the art of assassination. He developed a great resistance against all types of poisons and has a high tolerance to electricity. Zeno estimates that in his long career as an assassin, he never killed a person he had not been paid to eliminate.
                    <br><br>According to Killua, Zeno used to do infiltration in the Republic of East Gorteau. He is an old acquaintance of the Hunter Association's Chairman Netero. The two have known each other since Zeno was a baby.

                <h3>Abilities & Powers</h3>
                <p>
                    Zeno's enviable mastery over Nen, his training as an assassin, the experience gleaned over the years of activity and his calm and analytic mind make him an extremely powerful fighter. His name alone is enough to frighten anyone with knowledge about the underworld. Zeno confidently stated that it would only take him less than seven seconds to kill a whole group of armed Mafia members, and that Chrollo Lucilfer, the leader of the Phantom Troupe, would require his full strength and intent to kill to defeat Zeno. During their fight, he managed to force Chrollo onto the defensive. Neferpitou, a member of the Royal Guard, grew very excited to confront him, having sensed his power through their En. Zeno is also very perceptive, as he detected Killua had removed Illumi's needle from his brain.
