                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    The 12th Chairman of the Hunter Association and the Head of the Exam Commission. In his youth, he was extolled as the most powerful Nen user in the world, and retained dreadful strength even in his old age.

                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>
                    Netero was energetic, playful to the point of being mischievous, and, at times, seemingly absentminded. Although he was capable of acting professionally when called to intervene as Chairman of the Hunter Association, on all other occasions, he proved himself to be so extravagant he was sometimes called insane. There were clear discrepancies between his words and his thoughts during the 287th Hunter Exam. However, he was a true martial artist who was nothing but earnest during fights. He enjoyed challenges, and was thrilled by the prospect of a formidable enemy. This strange passion affected the way in which he governed the Hunter Association, frequently testing the physical limits of those attempting to become Hunters. He himself liked challenges, to the point he wanted his Vice-Chairman to be someone he just could not get along with. He apparently made a name for himself as a lustful man in the Hunter Association, since many Hunters left risqué magazines under his effigy as a tribute.

                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    The circumstances in which Netero became a Hunter and learned Nen are unknown. His proficiency was such that it earned him the title of most powerful Nen user in the world.
                    <br><br>Netero was trained in martial arts and, at the age of 46, during the winter, he believed that he had reached the pinnacle of his physical potential and went up into the mountains to reflect. During his time there, he came to the realization that was infinitely grateful to the martial arts for making him the man he was and vowed that he would show his gratitude in his own unique way, by doing a set of ten thousand punches and prayers daily. He would focus his chi, put his hands together, say a prayer, and then punch. On the first day, this sequence took five to six seconds, and it took him over eighteen hours to complete the ten thousand punches. After completing the ritual, he would collapse from exhaustion and fall into a deep sleep, only to awaken and repeat the ten thousand punches the next day. This would become Netero's daily routine for the next two years.

                <h3>Abilities & Powers</h3>
                <p>
                    Isaac Netero had the greatest authority in the Hunter Association due to his status as chairman.
                    <br><br>In his youth, Netero was revered as the world's most powerful Nen user. Although the survival rate of the official expeditions to the Dark Continent is a mere 0.04%, Netero set foot on it twice and returned alive with no signs of lasting injury both times. Even in his old age, Netero remains extremely powerful, with Morel asserting that if Netero cannot defeat an opponent, then no one in the entire Hunter Association can. While fighting Chimera Ants, the Chairman remarked that he was getting his strength back, suggesting that some of his lost strength had returned to him. Netero displayed incredible strength and stamina for his age, shown when he made a 60-foot free-fall jump from the Judging Committee's blimp without a parachute and landed without incurring any harm. He is also a very powerful hand-to-hand combatant, capable of unleashing punches that far exceed the speed of sound. Furthermore, he is extremely knowledgeable in martial arts, recognizing Killua's Rhythm Echo at a glance.
