                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    A cat-humanoid Chimera Ant and the firstborn of the Chimera Ant King's three Royal Guards.

                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>
                    Neferpitou was very loyal to the King and would sacrifice themself for him. Of the three Royal Guards, Pitou was the most curious and would get distracted easily and loved to play, and according to Shaiapouf, would get carried away when having fun. Pitou was a cat Chimera Ant, and like a cat, loved to play with their opponents like a cat would with their prey. Despite their cheerful and playful manner though, Pitou had a cruel and terrifying personality as well. Pitou also took their duty to protect the King seriously and was willing to sacrifice their chance to fight strong opponents to fulfill their duty.
                    <br><br>Unlike Menthuthuyoupi and Shaiapouf, Neferpitou did not seem to mind Meruem's later newfound interests in Komugi. Thus, among the three Royal Guards, Neferpitou was the only one that greatly prioritized Komugi's safety as opposed to Menthuthuyoupi and Shaiapouf's hatred towards Komugi, something Neferpitou was aware of which created distrust in regards to the matter, for making their king deviate from the path they envisioned for him.

                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    Neferpitou was the first of the three Royal Guards born for the Chimera Ant King. They were personally named by the Queen, as were the other Royal Guards. Like Menthuthuyoupi, Neferpitou appeared to have no memories of their previous life, if they had one.

                <h3>Abilities & Powers</h3>
                <p>
                    As one of the three members of the Royal Guard, Neferpitou is one of the most powerful Chimera Ants to live, and one of the strongest characters in the series. They fought and killed Kite, a powerful Pro Hunter, while suffering only minor injuries, and shortly after discovering Nen. Illumi referred to Neferpitou as Meruem's "top soldier". Despite intending to kill them, the King was only able to bruise Neferpitou with one of his tail strikes, which caused him to praise the Royal Guard. Shaiapouf, another Royal Guard member, was driven through a wall by the same attack, although the King's power had increased by that time. The Hunter Association's Chairman Netero, considered the world's strongest Hunter in his prime and by some the most powerful Hunter even in his old age, wondered if Neferpitou could be more powerful than him, as Colt, after witnessing both fighters' aura, later affirmed. Ikalgo was confident that even if he joined forces with Gon, Killua, and Palm, as well as, possibly, Knuckle and Meleoron, the Royal Guard would still come out on top.
