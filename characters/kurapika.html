                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    The last survivor of the Kurta Clan. He is a Blacklist Hunter and current leader of the organization founded by Light Nostrade. He is a member of the Zodiacs with the codename 'Rat'. His goal is to avenge his clan and recover the remaining Scarlet Eyes.

                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>
                    Kurapika is a cool and intelligent individual, possessing vast knowledge. He is reticent; not one to open up to people easily and quite judgmental. His distance from others initially keeps him level-headed and moralistic, but his heart has been poisoned with sadness and hatred. Having been traumatized from losing everyone he loved at the age of twelve, Kurapika closes his heart to new people and remains introverted as to stay focused on his goal. However, Kurapika can be kind and affectionate, smiling when those friends are happy. Though Kurapika outwardly states that he desires to become a Blacklist Hunter and his ultimate goal is to capture the band of thieves that massacred his family, he is willing to compromise his personal morality and delve into the squalid side of society in order to achieve his goal. He is prone to fits of uncontrollable anger should the memory of his clan be insulted in any way.

                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    Kurapika was born to the Kurta Clan in a secluded forest in the Lukso Province. As a child, he almost fell from a cliff but was saved by his best friend, Pairo. While he was unharmed, his friend Pairo had harmed both his legs and eyes, their condition worsening every day. Kurapika felt responsible for the incident and resolved to leave the forest and search the outside world for a doctor who could cure Pairo. Kurapika thus approached the Kurta Clan's elder several times to request to go to the outside world, but he was constantly refused. This sparked a long-lasting debate between the two, with Kurapika perceiving the Kurta Clan's fear of the outside world as unreasonable and backward. After one such argument, he talked to Pairo and discovered that people outside of the Kurta Clan do not have Scarlet Eyes, which caused their clan to be persecuted.

                <h3>Abilities & Powers</h3>
                <p>
                    Kurapika has all the benefits granted by his status as a Hunter. As a Zodiac, his authority in the Hunter Association is inferior only to that of the chairman herself. Being Light Nostrade's right-hand man, he had power over the clan and is now the boss of Light's new organization. Kurapika's powers increase greatly as the series progresses. Hisoka was the first to grow interested in him, listing him as one of the "green fruit" with vast potential. Although at the beginning he was weaker than Killua, during the Yorknew City arc he had become stronger than him due to his Nen abilities.
                    <br><br>He is one of the few characters (the others being Hisoka and Silva) to have killed a member of the infamous Phantom Troupe, and a very potent one. His exceptional intelligence is matched by high combat prowess and iron will that stems from his desire for revenge. He is also very versatile as he has been seen wielding different weapons. In his showdown with Uvogin, he used his chains when afar and at close quarter combat. While he usually maintains a calm and collected persona, he tends to lose his cool whenever the Phantom Troupe or his clan, are nominated, often turning violent.
