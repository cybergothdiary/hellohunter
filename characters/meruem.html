                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    The most powerful offspring of the Chimera Ant Queen. He was known as the "King" (王おう, Ō) of the Chimera Ants, and served as the main antagonist of the Chimera Ant arc.

                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>
                    Meruem was initially a cruel and violent leader. The Queen's intention to give birth to a perfect offspring was reflected in Meruem's haughty mentality. He considered himself superior to all other forms of life and felt no concern for his dying mother after his birth. Meruem was merciless, killing[3] and cannibalizing any Chimera Ant he deemed to be disrespectful, although he still held respect towards the strong, complimenting Neferpitou for emerging relatively unscathed from an attack that had killed many. He hated saying the same thing twice, and he would often tell others that he would not repeat himself. He showed no empathy towards humans and viewed them as nothing other than a food source, killing and devouring a child not long after his birth and subsequent departure from the Chimera Ants' nest, only to spit out the child's flesh and calling it disgusting compared to the sensations he occasionally experienced while in his mother's womb.
                    <br><br>
                    Later on, however, Meruem began to grudgingly respect a human girl named Komugi, eventually even growing to care for her deeply. With this change in heart, Meruem started to question the differences between Ants and mankind and battled with his identity as half-human and half-insect, questioning the nature of violence and strength as true power. After his interactions with Komugi and his fight against Netero, Meruem began to see humans as incredible beings with immense potential through their tenacity in breaking their own limits. He showed great respect and complete admiration for Netero, viewing his abilities and fighting style as truly magnificent, and constantly praised him throughout their battle, referring him as a rare example of a human who has transcended his limitations and the very pinnacle of human capabilities. Because of this change in perspective, Meruem no longer considered farming humans for food and instead suggested the co-existence of humans and Ants, with humans being selected and controlled for quality.

                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    Meruem is prematurely born. When his mother feels him trying to come out, she screams it is too soon, only for him to tell her to shut up and forcibly rip himself out of his sack. In doing so, he causes severe internal injuries to the Queen Ant; however, he does not care about her and demands food from the assembled Squadron Leaders.

                <h3>Abilities & Powers</h3>
                <p>
                    Despite being a newborn, Meruem is the most powerful character to be introduced in the series thus far, as well as the one with the highest learning ability. Born as the ultimate biological weapon, his tremendous physical prowess is only matched by an unparalleled intellect, both of which seem to place him well above the realm of human possibility. As the King of the Chimera Ants, his power exceeds even that of the Royal Guards, and he can increase it even further by consuming Nen users. He fought Isaac Netero, formerly considered the strongest Nen user in the world, who retained a fearsome level of power even in his old age, while trying not to kill him, a condition Meruem likened to playing chess without a rook and bishop, and won their physical confrontation. After the absorption of most of Shaiapouf's and Menthuthuyoupi's bodies, Knuckle believed that military power at the state level would be necessary to match him. As the king of a colony of Chimera Ants, Meruem has authority over the Royal Guards and the ability to procreate with females from different species.
