                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    The second youngest child of Silva and Kikyo Zoldyck. Under unknown circumstances, she was possessed by a mysterious Dark Continent creature, which her family named Nanika. The two currently share Alluka's body.

                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>
                    Before Alluka's formal introduction, Silva refers to her as a dark and uncontrollable child. He claims that Alluka has no soul because of the circumstances of her birth, and cannot feel emotions. However, once reunited with her closest brother Killua, Alluka displays an affectionate, simple, and lovable personality. Alluka is usually very happy around Killua and trusts him deeply, likely because he was the only one to show her compassion.
                    <br>According to Killua, Alluka calls him "big brother", while Nanika calls him only by name.

                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    Alluka first appears in a family photo of the Zoldyck siblings and their mother. In the photo, Alluka was not posing with the rest of the family; instead, she was standing at a distance behind them and facing away.
                    <br><br>It is unknown when and how Nanika came to possess Alluka, but the two have shared the latter's body at least since Alluka was a young child. The Zoldyck Family is in the dark about Nanika's nature. Killua once saw Alluka turn into Nanika, and learned about the general nature of its abilities by asking it how to revert the transformation. It turned out that when Alluka had three requests fulfilled, her eyes and mouth would turn pitch-black, and they would change back to normal only when she heard and granted a wish.

                <h3>Abilities & Powers</h3>
                <p>
                    Unlike her brothers, Alluka has no combat abilities at all. She is like a normal kid when it comes to fighting and physical endurance. However, due to being Nanika's host, her own relatives fear her ability to wipe out the family in an instant. Alluka shares an empathic link with Nanika, which allows her to perceive its emotions.
