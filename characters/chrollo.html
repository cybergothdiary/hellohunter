                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    The founder, leader, and member #0 of the Phantom Troupe. His physical strength ranked seventh among the group.

            <div class="article-block">
                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>
                    Chrollo is calm, intelligent, and charismatic, as he seems to be a born leader and able to hold the Troupe together despite the volatile personalities of its members. While he is a very capable strategist, Chrollo is also very confident in his own fighting abilities as well as in those of the other members of the Spider. He always has at least two people with him, which is why Hisoka found it so difficult to fight him. After he has admired the items that he targeted and acquired, Chrollo sells them all. It is also stated that Chrollo likes antique books.

                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    Very little is known about Chrollo's past except that he originated from Meteor City, a junkyard city inhabited by outcasts. People who live there do not exist in any official records and the existence of the city itself is known to a very few people.Sometime in the past, he formed the Phantom Troupe with six other Meteor City residents.It is unknown when and what the exact circumstances were, but Chrollo previously fought Silva Zoldyck before their encounter in the Cemetery Building.

                <h3>Abilities & Powers</h3>
                <p>
                    As the leader of the Phantom Troupe, Chrollo is an exceptional fighter and revered as the strongest by most of its members. Machi ranks him cleanly above Hisoka, who has consistently desired a fight against the Troupe's leader far more than any other Spider. However, Chrollo tends to hold back if his opponent possesses an ability that interests him so that he can steal it. He was able to fight against Silva and Zeno Zoldyck simultaneously, both extremely proficient assassins, without leaving any openings for the former to exploit, though he was unable to cause significant damage to either of them and was ultimately saved by Illumi fulfilling his contract. In the past, he survived a confrontation with Silva, and Zeno stated that he would surely win if Chrollo fought to steal his ability, but that his victory would be less certain if Chrollo were serious about killing him. His greatest achievement on the battlefield may be his victory at Heavens Arena against Hisoka, another extremely powerful Nen user who at the time had no record of past defeats or even proof of struggling in fights.
