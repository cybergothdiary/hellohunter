                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    The current head and lead assassin of the Zoldyck Family, the father of Killua.

                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>
                    Silva is a stoic, calm, and pensive person. Silva has little shown interaction with his son Killua, but he holds him in high esteem and has made Killua the heir to the family. Silva later realized that Killua didn't share his passion for assassination, and allowed his son to go with Gon on their journey to find his father, but only because he saw it as a crucial step in Killua's development as the heir to the Zoldyck Family. He is shown to dislike Zeno's somewhat windbag attitude and reminds himself to ignore half of everything Zeno says whenever Zeno has a new experience to talk about.

                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    He is Zeno's only son and was born from an unnamed mother. He's also the only great-grandson of Maha. Not much is known about his childhood, but he was trained since a very young age in the art of assassination, which gave him such abilities such as strong resistance to almost all types of poisons and high tolerance to electricity. Later on in his life, he married his wife Kikyo, a fellow assassin, and fathered five children with her. At some point prior to the start of the series, he killed an unknown member of the Phantom Troupe and fought their leader, Chrollo Lucilfer.

                <h3>Abilities & Powers</h3>
                <p>
                    Being a world-renowned assassin and head of the infamous Zoldyck Family, Silva is an extremely skilled Nen user and unarmed combatant, as he was trained in the art of assassination from a very young age. Like many Zoldyck Family members, Silva is extremely resistant to poison and has great strength, speed, and superhuman control over his body. He also defeated and killed an unknown member of the Phantom Troupe three years prior to the start of the main story, and dueled against Chrollo to an unknown result (both of them survived, though, and in the anime, Silva was shown coming back with no visible injury).
