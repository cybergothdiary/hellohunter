                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    A Rookie Hunter and a member of the Zodiacs with the codename 'Boar'. He is currently a medical student, studying to become a doctor.

                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>
                    Leorio is initially introduced as a very selfish narcissist who places great emphasis on material wealth. Despite his assertions that he is only after money, he eventually reveals to Kurapika that his dream is to one day become a doctor in order to help the poor. He believes that all things in the world (lives, dreams, etc.) can be bought and that becoming a Hunter will provide him with the necessary funds for his medical education. Due to his first spat with Kurapika, as well as the test on the way to the navigator's cabin, it seems that he has a sensitivity for those who do not take him seriously or treat him with disrespect. His real priorities seem to be friends first, then his dream of becoming a great doctor, with everything else afterward.

                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    Leorio once lost a close friend (a boy named Pietro in the 1999 anime adaptation) to a debilitating illness. Leorio feels deeply remorseful about being unable to save his friend, as the illness was entirely curable but required a surgery he could not afford. Thus, he aspires to become a doctor—one who not only cures the ill of their diseases, but also one who works pro-bono for people who cannot afford it. In this light, his outwardly superficial reason to join the Hunter Exams in the pursuit of great wealth gains a more noble justification—the money he earns is used not only to fund his medical school fees but also to pay for the medicine and other miscellaneous expenditures when treating those who can not afford it.

                <h3>Abilities & Powers</h3>
                <p>
                    As a member of the Zodiacs, Leorio's authority exceeds that of most Hunters. Although this is partly owed to Ging's actions, Leorio's charisma conquered a great number of Hunters so that he became a finalist during the election of the 13th Chairman of the Hunter Association. His great popularity is also the reason he was selected as a Staff Advisor. Although he was apparently deemed capable enough to participate in the dangerous expedition to the Dark Continent, Leorio's actual fighting skills are unknown. During the Hunter Exam, he was able to survive the throw of one of Hisoka's cards, although he was still injured, and Netero declared his combat prowess to be superior to Bodoro's. He left a strong enough impression on Hisoka to be deemed an opponent worth giving the chance to "mature". Despite being moderately observant, Leorio's temper often causes him to act rashly.
