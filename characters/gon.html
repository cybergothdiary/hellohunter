                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>

                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>
                    Gon is an athletic, rustic, and friendly boy who is searching for adventure. Also, he is not very good at math. However, having spent a lot of time in the woods as a child, he is very good with animals. Gon is an Enhancer, who are known for being simple-minded and determined. This determination and talent lead to both potential allies and potential enemies trusting in him and taking his side. He has inhuman senses; Gon has a heightened sense of smell almost like a dog's, he also has very good vision, as well as having a very keen taste. Gon wants to become a Hunter because he wishes to find out the depths of an occupation that would cause a father to choose the profession over being with his own son.

                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    At the age of twenty, Ging Freecss returned home to Whale Island for the first time in eight years carrying his infant son, Gon. When questioned about the child's mother, Ging simply mentioned that the pair had separated. While Ging tried to leave Gon in his grandmother's care for a little while, Ging's cousin Mito was infuriated at Ging's parenting and got custody through the courts. Ging left Whale Island, never to return.
                    <br>Since his early youth, due to his father's absence and Mito's dislike of Ging, Gon was told that his parents died in an accident when he was a baby. At the age of nine, however, Gon was rescued from an angry mother Foxbear by a man named Kite—a professional Hunter and a student of Gon's long lost father. After hitting Gon in the face, Kite attempted to kill the Foxbear's cub but Gon protected it. Kite admitted to looking for Ging as a final test to be seen by his master as a true Hunter. Kite's admiration of Ging awoke in Gon the goal of meeting his father. In order to do so, Gon was driven from that moment to obtain a Hunter License, also desiring to know what would cause Ging to choose his profession as a Hunter over being a parent as his motivation for becoming a Hunter.

                <h3>Abilities & Powers</h3>
                <p>
                    Gon has all the benefits granted by his status as a Hunter. At the beginning of the series, he had a fishing rod that he could swing with baffling accuracy, even managing to catch Hisoka's tag from afar while the latter was moving at high speed. The fishing rod can also be used as an offensive weapon if the situation asks for it. During the Hunter Exam, Gon was often praised for his powers of observation, agility, and stamina. In battle, he thinks quickly for any alternative solutions and strategies. His most remarkable quality, however, is the uncanny, bottomless potential he is gifted with. Many powerful characters such as Hisoka, Wing, Biscuit, and Razor were left astounded when they grasped the full extent of Gon's talent, which is often described as being limitless. This allows him to learn extremely quickly, and that is true especially in the field of Nen, with an aptitude like his being very rare. Even prior to learning it, he managed to use Zetsu on one occasion.
